    <title>Dansk - for foreigners</title>
    <!--to the reviewer : the reason comments are on english is that most of people know there own language and at least some english, so this is the way someone who is interested about the code can see whats going on-->

    <!--breef note: this is my way of practicing danish so sorry for inprefection, and plane wrong spelling-->

    <!--this is my way of getting to know something I'm interested in-->

    <!--so, for hum will this site be, my wish is to first be for my future danish friends who will tell me everything I got wrong haha, but then, for people who are interested in there culture and way of life, and I think there is much to learn from Dans-->

    <!--by writting all of this here I hope that I will not have the need to rent about this stuff in the page itself, wish me luck-->
